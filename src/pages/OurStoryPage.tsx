          <p>The Medical Service Corps (MSC) is the most highly diversified Corps within Navy medicine. An integral part of the Navy, 
            the Medical Service Corps is comprised of a multidisciplinary team of commissioned Naval Officers in clinical,
            scientific, and administrative health care fields.</p>
            <h2>A Brief History</h2>
            <p>Originally called the Navy Hospital Corps in World War I, its vital role expanded during World War II - as the military recognized the need for a 
              permanent, all-officer medical category comprised of individuals trained in administrative, professional, and scientific specialties.  
              The Medical Service Corps was officially authorized by the Army-Navy Medical Service Corps Act of 1947.
            </p>

            <h2>The Medical Service Corps Today</h2>
            <p>The Medical Service Corps is comprised of thirty one sub specialties, organized under three major categories: Healthcare Administrators, 
              Clinicians, and Scientists.  The Medical Service Corps has approximately 2,800 officers on active duty and 350 officers serving in the reserve 
              component.  Health Care Scientists make up 24 percent of the MSC; Health Care Clinicians make up 40 percent, serving in 22 different specialties, 
              while Health Care Administrators comprise the remaining 36 percent.
            </p>

            <p>MSC Officers serve in more than 250 naval and medical commands throughout the world.  
              About 65 percent serve in facilities delivering direct patient care and 35 percent serve in operational units, training and research commands, 
              occupational and preventive medicine units, material and logistic support commands and headquarters commands.
            </p>
            <h2>Our Mission</h2>
            <p>The Medical Service Corps actively supports the Navy and Marine Corps team and Navy Medicine's 
              readiness and health benefits missions with a community of active duty and reserve component professionals.
            </p>
            <h2>Our Vision</h2>
            <p>One Corps of many specialties meeting today's needs and tomorrow's challenges.</p>
