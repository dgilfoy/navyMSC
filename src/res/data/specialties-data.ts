      <p>Navy Aerospace and Operational Physiologists train all U.S. Navy and Marine Corps Aircrew in the areas of aviation physiology, sensory physiology, 
      acceleration physiology, life support equipment, ejection/egress, parachute procedures and water survival. This training reduces the risk of mishaps 
      from taking place, and enhances survival changes when mishaps occur.</p>
